Equivalence Class Partitioning:
- Inputs of the software or system are divided into groups that are expected to exhibits similar behavior, so they are
  likely to be proposed in the same way. hence selecting one input from each group to design the test case.
- It helps to reduce the total number of test case from infinite to finite, The selected test cases from these groups
   ensure coverage of all possible scenarios.
   
   
Testing Terminologies:
----------------------
Sanity Testing and Smoke testing:
--------------------------------
-> Initial builds when the software is relatively unstable -> Verifies critical functionalities like application starts successfully -> SMOKE TESTING.
smoke it all about checking stability of the software

-> Relatively stable builds after multiple rounds of regression tests -> Verifies new funtionality,bug fixes in the build -> SANITY TESTING.
this is done to verify rationality of the system in order to proceed with rigorus testing.

if its fails, we will reject the build.
Goes by many names Build verification test, Tester acceptance test, shakedown etc

Re-testing vs Regression Testing:
---------------------------------
- Repeated testing of an already tested program, after modification, to discover any defects introduced or uncovered as a result of the changes
  in the software being tested or in another related or unrelated software components.
- Usually, we do regression testing in the following cases:
  - New functionalities are added to application.
  - Change requirement
  - Defect fixes
  - Performance issue fixes
  - Environmental change(updating DB from MySql to oracle etc).

 Once the bug is fixed, tester need to do RETesting to verify bug
 Regression testing is testing also the authenticity of the software(correct logical flow)
 
Globalization Testing vs Localization Testing:
---------------------------------------------
L10N Testing: Is the software testing process for checking the localized version of a product for that particular culture or locale settings.
UI and content testing.

I18N testing : this test is to ensure that application can function in any culture or locale.

Product -> Product is designed to work for specific culture or local -> Localization testing.
Product -> Product is designed to work in any culture or local -> Gloablization Testing.
Eg : Date format, is different for different countries.

END to END Testing:
-> Testing the overall functionalities of the system including the data integration among all the modules is called end to end testing.

eg: login,add new customer, edit customer, delete customer,logout ---> Test entire functionality( test cases )

Exploratory testing:(0 knowledge-> learning)
---------------------
-> It is all about discovery, investigation and learning.
-> It emphasizes on personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester.
-> Test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly.
-> The focus of exploratory testing is more on testing as a thinking activity.

When to use this?
-> Exploratory testing can  be used extensively when the tester team has experienced testers.
Early iteration is required, Critical application, new testers entered into the team.

Adhoc Testing:(Random testing )
-> This is an informal testing type with a aim to break the system.
-> Usually unplanned activity.
-> Doesnt ahve any test design techiques to create test cases, In fact is does not create test cases althogeher.
This testing is primarily perfomed if the knowledge of tester in the system under test is very high.
-> Tester randomly test the application without any test cases or any business requirement documents.

we know little about application and we are testing randomly.


AdHoc Testing, Monkey Testing, Exploratory Testing:
all 3 are very similar.
Adhoc and monkey is to break the application, Exploratory is about learning application.
adhoc is for any application.
Monkey is for Game application.
Exploratory is any application which is new to tester.
